          <h2>FAQs — Google Ads Agency in Patna</h2>

          <h3>How much does it cost to run Google Ads in Patna?</h3>
          <p>
            Budgets can start at ₹10,000/month. Competitive niches like healthcare
            or real estate often see better performance at ₹20,000–₹50,000/month.
          </p>

          <h3>How soon can I see results?</h3>
          <p>Many accounts generate leads within 24–48 hours of launch.</p>

          <h3>Will I be charged if no one clicks my ad?</h3>
          <p>No. Google Ads is PPC—you’re charged only on clicks.</p>

          <h3>Can I run Google Ads myself?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, but without targeting, testing, and tracking, budgets tend to
            leak on irrelevant clicks.
          </p>

          <h3>Are Google Ads better than SEO?</h3>
          <p>
            They solve different needs—Ads = instant results; SEO = long-term
            compounding visibility. The best strategy combines both.
          </p>

          <h3>How do I choose the best agency?</h3>
          <p>
            Look for proven results, transparent reporting, landing-page
            expertise, and clear optimization cadences.
