        <p>
          In the crowded ecommerce landscape, visibility is everything. If your
          store doesn’t appear when customers in Patna or across Bihar search
          for your products, you’re losing sales. This guide explains{" "}
          <strong>Ecommerce SEO</strong>—from keyword research to technical
          fixes—so your online store ranks higher, attracts qualified traffic,
          and converts more visitors.

      <section id="what-is-ecommerce-seo">
        <h2>What is Ecommerce SEO?</h2>
        <p>
          Ecommerce SEO is the process of optimising an online store to rank
          higher on search engines. It spans keyword strategy, product &amp;
          category page optimisation, site architecture, speed, and content.
          The goal is simple: <em>win intent-driven traffic that converts</em>.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase visibility for commercial product queries</li>
          <li>Drive qualified, purchase-ready traffic</li>
          <li>Boost conversions and revenue without relying only on ads</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="why-it-matters">
        <h2>Why It Matters for Your Store</h2>
        <p>
          Most shopping journeys start with search, and the majority of users
          don’t look beyond page one. Ranking higher builds trust and captures
          more clicks—especially for local intent like “buy shoes in Patna” or
          “laptop store Bihar online”.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="foundations">
        <h2>Foundations of Ecommerce SEO</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Solid keyword research mapped to user intent</li>
          <li>
            Optimised product pages (titles, descriptions, structured data)
          </li>
          <li>High-quality category &amp; faceted navigation strategy</li>
          <li>Fast, mobile-first, and technically clean website</li>

        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="keyword-research">
        <h3>Keyword Research for Ecommerce</h3>
        <p>
          Target buyer-intent and long-tail phrases that indicate readiness to
          purchase (e.g., “buy eco-friendly yoga mat”, “best DSLR under 50k in
          Patna”). Combine product terms with modifiers like brand, price,
          size, colour, and location.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Build keyword clusters for each category and prioritise by demand
            and competitiveness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Map every target keyword to a single page to avoid cannibalisation.
          </li>
          <li>
            Localise where relevant: “online grocery delivery in Patna”,
            “furniture store Bihar”.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="onpage-product">

        <p>
          Product pages are your revenue pages. Make them discoverable and
          convincing:

          <li>
            <strong>Titles &amp; H1s:</strong> Include primary keyword +
            modifiers (brand, model, colour, location if relevant).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Descriptions:</strong> Benefit-led, unique content—avoid

            <strong>Media:</strong> Compressed images, descriptive{" "}
            <code>alt</code> text, and demo videos where possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Structured Data:</strong> Add Product + Review + Offer
            schema to enable rich results (price, ratings, availability).
          </li>

        <h3>Category Page Optimisation</h3>
        <p>
          Category pages often capture broader search demand and can outrank
          products:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Unique intro copy explaining the range, use-cases, and key
            differentiators.

          <li>
            Logical filters (price, size, brand) with crawl control to prevent
            duplicate/faceted index bloat.
          </li>
          <li>
            Internal links to best-sellers and top sub-categories to distribute
            authority.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optimised meta title/description and header hierarchy (H1→H2→H3).

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Faceted Navigation:</strong> Decide which combinations are

            parameter rules.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Internal Linking:</strong> Contextual links from blogs and

        <ul>
