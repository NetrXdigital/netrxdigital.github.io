        <p>
          In the competitive Patna healthcare sector, traditional advertising isn’t enough. Patients are
          searching online and expect clear, personalised information before choosing a clinic or doctor.
          Performance marketing gives medical practices the power to reach patients through measurable,
          data-driven strategies—focusing only on what delivers results.

      <section id="definition">
        <h2>What Is Performance Marketing?</h2>
        <p>
          Performance marketing refers to digital advertising efforts where you only pay for specific, measurable
          actions—such as a website visit, appointment booking, or phone call—rather than broad reach or impressions.
          Unlike traditional advertising, every rupee spent is tracked and tied directly to your clinic’s business
          goals, helping you maximise return on investment.

      <section id="components">
        <h2>Core Components of Performance Marketing</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Pay-Per-Click (PPC) Ads:</strong> Ads on Google or Facebook that appear when potential patients
            search for services like “pediatrician Patna” or “best physiotherapist near me.” Clinics are charged only
            when users click the ad.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Social Media Campaigns:</strong> Target audiences by location, age, and health interests on
            platforms like Instagram and Facebook to drive direct engagement and inquiries.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Landing Page Optimization:</strong> Custom, fast-loading pages designed for each campaign to turn
            clicks into actual patient leads. Keep ad-to-page message match, ensure mobile-friendly design, and place
            prominent calls-to-action.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO):</strong> A/B test headlines, images, and booking forms to
            increase the percentage of visitors who become paying patients.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="how-to">
        <h2>How to Launch a Successful Performance Marketing Campaign</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Set Clear Goals:</strong> Decide if the campaign aims to get bookings, generate calls, or raise
            awareness for specific health services.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Know Your Audience:</strong> Target new or returning patients and tailor messaging to their needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Choose Effective Channels:</strong> Use Google Ads, social media, or even WhatsApp—go where your
            patients are most active.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Monitor & Optimise:</strong> Track KPIs like traffic, leads, conversion rate, and cost-per-acquisition.
            Use analytics to refine targeting, messaging, and spend.
