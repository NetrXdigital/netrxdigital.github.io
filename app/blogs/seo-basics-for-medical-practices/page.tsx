        <p>
          In Patna’s fast-evolving healthcare landscape, medical practices are discovering that search
          engine optimisation (SEO) is no longer optional but essential for attracting new patients.
          With more individuals searching for doctors and clinics online, ranking on the first page of
          Google for local health services is a vital part of practice growth and credibility.

      <section id="what-is-medical-seo">
        <h2>What Is Medical SEO and Why Does It Matter?</h2>
        <p>
          Medical SEO refers to the process of optimising a healthcare practice’s website so it appears
          higher in search engine results when patients look for specific treatments, symptoms, or local
          practitioners. Successful SEO helps medical practices:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Increase visibility with prospective patients searching for healthcare services</li>
          <li>Establish trust and expertise in their medical field</li>
          <li>Drive organic traffic, resulting in more appointments and walk-ins</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

        <h2>Essential SEO Strategies for Medical Websites</h2>
      </section>

      <section id="local-listings">
        <h3>1) Claim and Optimise Local Listings</h3>
        <p>
          Local SEO is critical for healthcare businesses. Claim your Google Business Profile and other
          local directories. Ensure your Name, Address, and Phone number (NAP) are accurate and
          consistent everywhere. Add clear photos, up-to-date business hours, service descriptions, and
          reply professionally to patient reviews.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="keyword-research">
        <h3>2) Keyword Research: Find the Right Search Terms</h3>
        <p>
          Begin with targeted, location-specific keywords that patients use to search for clinics and
          doctors in Patna. Examples include “skin specialist in Patna” or “best dental clinic near me.”
          Use tools like Google Keyword Planner or SEMrush to identify and integrate these relevant
          phrases in your website’s titles, headings, and body content.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="content">
        <h3>3) Create High-Quality, Helpful Content</h3>
        <p>
          Publish informative blog posts about common health concerns, treatments, and frequently asked
          questions. Value-driven content not only attracts visitors but also establishes your expertise
          and authority—an important ranking factor for Google.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="ux">
        <h3>4) Improve Website Experience</h3>
        <p>
          Google rewards websites that are fast, secure, and easy to navigate. Make sure your site
          loads quickly, is mobile-friendly, and uses HTTPS for security. Ensure navigation is seamless
          and appointment booking is simple for users.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="eeat">
        <h3>5) Build Credibility and Trust (E-E-A-T)</h3>
        <p>
          Google uses E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) to rank
          websites tackling health topics. Display doctor profiles, accreditations, genuine
          testimonials, and accurate medical content reviewed by clinicians. Respond to both positive
          and negative patient reviews online.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="technical">
        <h3>6) Keep Metadata and Technical SEO Optimised</h3>
        <p>
          Craft unique, compelling meta titles and descriptions for every page using your target
          keywords. Optimise image file names and alt text, use structured data to highlight your
          services, and routinely check for technical errors that might hinder your site’s performance.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section id="why-now">
        <h2>Why Focus on SEO Now?</h2>
        <p>
          SEO isn’t just about higher search rankings for medical practices—it’s an investment in
          trust, visibility, and long-term growth. In Patna, where healthcare choices are abundant,
          strong SEO ensures your clinic is discoverable, reputable, and ready to serve new patients
          online.
        </p>
        <p>
          With these basics, medical practices in Patna can set the foundation for a robust online
